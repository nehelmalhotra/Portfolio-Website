										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/formal.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hi, I am a Master's student at the University of Toronto studying Industrial Engineering and specialization in Data Science. Over the past few years, I have been privileged to be a part of some amazing teams in different industries and learned a lot of things. As part of my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, I graduated from the University of Waterloo with over 2 years of work experience in industries including aerospace, medical and automotive.</p>

<p>After graduation, I worked in the plastics industry for an injection molding machinery manufacturer as a Project Engineer. This position put me right at the center of every client meeting, engineering discussions and sales brainstorming sessions. I was responsible for all project management duties related to new and ongoing projects, preparing engineering layouts for sales meetings, conducting machine performance and cost analysis and using VBA to automate tasks. </p>
<br>
<br>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/casual.jpg" alt="" /></span>I had always enjoyed data analysis and problem solving, however I was unaware that a combination of these with statistics and linear algebra could lead to predicting outcomes of tasks and would be behind things like self-driving cars. This to me, is as close as we can get to real magic and this is when I decided to make the switch.</p>
											<p>I enjoy researching about new technologies and investing in disruptive and high growth companies. In my spare time, I try and complete Kaggle competitions as its a great source of learning through doing and from your peers. My personal hobbies include playing racquet sports such as tennis and squash and also trying out new coffee shops and board games. </p>
